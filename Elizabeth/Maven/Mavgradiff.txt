# DIFFENCES BETWEEN THE MAVEN AND GRADLE AUTOMATION BUILD TOOLS

1. The Maven tool-based projects aims at finishing the project within a given timeline, 
while the Gradle tool-based  projects aims at incorporating new functionality into the project.

2. Maven tool uses an Extensible markup language(XML) file in maintaining the list of components, project dependencies and other necessities 
while the Gradle project on the other hand does not use the XML file and the project configuration is distinctly maintained for Gradle tool projects.
